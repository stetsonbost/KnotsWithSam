# KnotsWithSam

This is the repository for the research Ben Garbuz and I are doing with Professor Sam Nelson.
Currently, we are working on finding finite-type invariants of knotted surfaces in 4-space.
I are writing a program that will automate this process because the computations can become quite extensive.

The GaussSubiagrams.py program enumerates the Gauss codes for all subdiagrams of a knotted surface, given its Gauss code.
Ths program is no longer used because we have
